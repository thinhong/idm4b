    "text": "Modelling\nA model is a simplified representation of a complex phenomenon1.\nWe all use models in our daily lives, often without realizing it. Imagine a colleague asks, “How long will it take to get to the new restaurant?”. There are different ways you might answer this question, each reflecting a different “model” in your head:\n\nExperience-based model: You might think, “Last week it took me 20 minutes to get to this restaurant”. This model simplifies by assuming past experiences are a reliable predictor of future outcomes, ignoring daily variations like traffic or weather.\nDistance and speed model: You might think, “The restaurant is 15 kilometers away, and I drive at 45 km/h, so it should take about 20 minutes”. This model uses the formula \\(\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\\). It simplifies by assuming a constant speed, and not accounting for real-world complexities like traffic lights or congestion.\n\nModels help us navigate and make decisions about complex situations by focusing on the most relevant factors and ignoring the less critical details.\n\n\n\n\n1.

The probability of observing all these data points at the same time is the production of these likelihood \\(\\mathbb{P}(x_1|M) \\times \\mathbb{P}(x_2|M) \\times \\mathbb{P}(x_3|M)... = \\prod\\mathbb{P}(x|M)\\).\nMultiplying things together, you will end up losing precision if the numbers are too low. Here you are dealing with probability (a value &lt; 1), multiplying 100 probabilities you will end up with 1e-100.\nBut remember that \\(log(a \\times b) = log(a) + log(b)\\), and very convenient that \\(log(1^{-100} = -230.2585)\\).\nSo \\(log(\\mathbb{P}(x_1|M) \\times \\mathbb{P}(x_2|M) \\times \\mathbb{P}(x_3|M)...)\\) \\(=\\) \\(log(\\mathbb{P}(x_1|M)) + log(\\mathbb{P}(x_2|M)) + log(\\mathbb{P}(x_3|M))...\\) and it is so much easier to handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use negative log-likelihood?\n\n\n\nBecause statistical packages optimizers work by minimizing a function. Minimizing means decrease the distance of two distributions to its lowest, this is fairly easy because we get this when the distance close to 0 (just like the trick we do in hypothesis testing).\nMinimizing negative log-likelihood (meaning that \\(-1 \\times \\text{log-likelihood}\\)) is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood, which is what we want to do (MLE: maximum likelihood estimation).",
