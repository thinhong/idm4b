Special thanks to my idol, Dr. James Hay, who once gave these genius advice:\n\n“Read and learn now - it will be harder later on.”\n“Spent a lot of time writing well-documented, generalisable code that didn’t necessarily turn into publications at the time. I now use that code all of the time.”\nDr. James Hay’s inspiring talk at the MIDSEA ECR April 2024 Meeting.\n\nThese words encouraged me to read and learn more, and to ensure every detail was carefully documented. In this book, you (and my future self) will find:\n\nA dictionary of jargon with cited definitions.\nMethodologies for mathematical models of infectious diseases.\nStep-by-step guides for writing infectious disease reports, following the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report format: data, workflow, analyses, and inference.\n\nIf you enjoyed this book or found any mistakes, please leave a comment below. Your feedback means a lot!",

As the outbreak progresses, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, leading to a decline in \\(R_0\\). This adjusted value is referred to as \\(R_t\\) (if we want to measure at each time \\(t\\)). At the peak of the epidemic curve, \\(R_t = 1\\). After this peak, \\(R_t\\) continues to decrease, resulting in a decline in the number of new cases and the epidemic curve going down.\n\\(R_t\\) can be defined in 2 ways: as the instantaneous reproduction number or as the case reproduction number (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\nInstantaneous reproduction number \\(R_t^i\\)\n\n\nFigure illustrates the Cori method (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\nMeasures transmission at a specific point in time (Gostic et al., 2020).

The standard assumption is that \\(w_s\\) follows a discretized gamma distribution, but any parametric or empirical discrete distribution also work (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\n\n3.1.1.3 When can we start estimating \\(R_t^i\\)?\nCori et al. suggest starting estimating \\(R_t^i\\) once those three criteria are fulfilled (Cori et al., 2013):\n\nAt least after the sliding window size.\nAt least after one mean serial interval.\nAt least 12 cases (the initial case + 11) have been observed since the beginning of the epidemic (in a time window): to get a posterior credible interval of 0.3, the time window must comprise at least 11 incident cases.\n\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Key considerations\nSource: Dr. Anne Cori’s webinar.\n\nTemporal resolution: we can’t apply the \\(R_t^i\\) method when the time step of observation is too large (&gt; mean generation interval).\nSpatial resolution: ideally use a spatial scale that you can distinguish locally infected cases from imported cases.\n\\(R_t^i\\) is very sensitive to the size of the sliding window: small windows can lead to highly variable estimates with wide credible intervals, whereas longer windows lead to smoothed estimates with narrower credible intervals. Perhaps also consider at least 11 incident cases in a sliding window to get a posterior credible interval of 0.3 (Cori et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Case reproduction number \\(R_t^c\\)\n\nDefinition 3.2 The case or cohort reproduction number is the expected number of secondary infections that an individual who becomes infected at time \\(t\\) will eventually cause as they progress through their infection (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\n\n3.1.2.1 Exact calculation\n\\[R_t^c = \\int_{u = t}^{\\infty} R_u^i w_{u-t} du\\]\n\n\\(R_u^i\\): the instantaneous reproduction number of current infected cases at time \\(u\\), starting from \\(t\\) to the end of their infectious period \\(\\infty\\).\n\\(w_{u-t}\\): the infectiousness of them at that time.\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Wallinga and Teunis method\nThere are 3 steps (Gostic et al., 2020):\nStep 1. Estimate the likelihood that case \\(j\\) (infected at time \\(t_j\\)) infected case \\(i\\) (at time \\(t_i\\)).\n\\[p_{ij} = \\frac{w_{t_i - t_j}}{\\sum_{i \\neq k} w_{t_i - t_k}}\\]\n\n\\(\\sum_{i \\neq k} w_{t_i - t_k}\\): sum of the infectiousness of all cases (other than \\(i\\)) infects case \\(i\\).\n\nStep 2. Compute the individual reproduction number of case \\(j\\).\n\\[R_j = \\sum_i p_{ij}\\]\nStep 3.

    "text": "3.4 Potential biases\n\\(R_t\\) is a value in specific time, therefore there are 2 potential forms of bias in \\(R_t\\) estimates (Gostic et al., 2020):\n\nAccuracy (the value): Systematic over- or underestimation caused by misspecification of the generation interval. Mostly impact when \\(R_t\\) is substantially &gt; 1 (e.g., the beginning of COVID-19 when \\(R_t\\) is relatively high) or &lt; 1 (e.g., after a very effective intervention then \\(R_t\\) might be low).\nTimeliness (the time): Temporal inaccuracy that \\(R_t\\) estimates may be leading or lagging the true date, has several possible causes and can be difficult to avoid.\n\n\n\nFigure from Sender et al. (Sender et al., 2022).\n\n\n3.4.1 Generation interval\n\nDefinition 3.3 Generation interval is the time from the infection of a primary case to infection of the cases he/she generates (Cori et al., 2013).\n\nIf we match this to an SEIR model, the generation interval starts when the infector enters the E compartment (meaning they got infected). The latest time they can infect an infectee is at the end of their residence in the I compartment (they are infectious). Therefore, generation interval is the sum of residence times in compartments E and I (Gostic et al., 2020).\nThe mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. Because when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a “race” to infect him/her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection (Kenah et al., 2008).\n\n\nBiases from misspecification of the generation interval mean (A) or variance (B) (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\n\nIf mean generation interval is set too high, \\(R_t\\) will be more extreme (too high when true \\(R_t &gt; 1\\) and too low when true \\(R_t &lt; 1\\)).\nIf mean generation interval is set too low, \\(R_t\\) will be closer to 1 than the true value.\nThe effect of the mean generation interval is large when true \\(R_t\\) further from 1. Therefore, this bias may be greatest at the early epidemic, when true \\(R_t\\) is high, together with highly uncertain generation interval and limited data.\n\nTools like EpiEstim and EpiNow2 allow users to specify the prior variance of the mean and standard deviation. However, bear in mind that uncertainty around an incorrect generation interval only widen the 95% credible interval, but will not shift the estimates toward the truth and will not correct this bias.\n\n\n3.4.2 Serial interval\n\nDefinition 3.4 Serial interval is the time between symptom onset in an infector–infectee pair (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\nSerial interval is more easily observed than generation interval and often used in its place. Although the serial and generation intervals are often conflated, there are important differences (Gostic et al., 2020):\n\nSerial interval and generation interval usually have the same mean, but different variances.\nSerial interval can be negative (when the symptom onset of infector is later than infectee, such as in COVID-19), generation interval is always positive.\n\nThe distributions of the serial interval and the generation interval are identical in these scenarios (Cori et al., 2013):\n\nFor diseases such as influenza, SARS, measles, and smallpox, it is expected that infectiousness starts only around the time of symptom onset.\nWhen the infectiousness profile after symptoms is independent of the incubation period.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Delays\n\n\nAdjusting for delays (Gostic et al., 2020).\n\nIf \\(d\\) is the delay from infection to observation, then observations at time \\(t\\) inform \\(R_{t − d}\\), not \\(R_t\\).\nIf the distribution of delays can be estimated, then \\(R_t\\) can be estimated in 2 steps:\n\nInfer the underlying time series of infections.\nInput the adjusted time series into an \\(R_t\\) estimation method.",
