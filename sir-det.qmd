# SIR

Assumptions:

-   Well-mixed population (a single contact rate $\beta$).
-   The most basic form balances demographic processes (births B and deaths $\mu$).
-   Infectious disease properties is for a single pathogen.

Force of infection $\lambda = \frac{\beta I}{N}$

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = B - \lambda S - \mu S$$

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \lambda S - \gamma I - \mu I$$

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \mu R$$
