# SIR

## Model {#sec-sir-mod}

![](img/det/sir.svg)

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI = -\lambda S$$ {#eq-sir-ds}

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I = \lambda S - \gamma I$$ {#eq-sir-di}

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I$$ {#eq-sir-dr}

-   $\beta$: effective contact rate.
-   $\gamma$: removal rate.
-   $\beta I = \lambda$: the rate from S to I is called **force of infection**.

## Assumptions

-   Each member of a population is either susceptible, infectious, or recovered [@vandendriessche2017].
-   The disease spreads through direct contact between susceptible and infected individuals.
-   Well-mixed population, or homogeneous mixing (represented by a single effective contact rate $\beta$) [@becker2017].
-   In the most basic form it considers a "closed population" without demographics (no births, deaths, or migration) [@keeling2011], make sense when the disease is short lived compared with the population lifetime [@vandendriessche2017].
-   There is no latent period, individuals become infectious immediately upon contracting the disease.
-   The effective contact rate $\beta$ and recovery rate $\gamma$ are constant over time.
-   Infectious disease properties are for a single pathogen [@becker2017].
-   Recovered individuals gain lifelong immunity.

**Density-dependent**

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI$$

- The unit of $\beta$ is $\frac{1}{\text{time} \times \text{people}}$.
- Transmission increases as density increases.
- Aerosol contacts (COVID-19).

## Code

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(odin)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(patchwork)
```

Below is how we numerically solve the differential equations @eq-sir-ds, @eq-sir-di, @eq-sir-dr in R with the `odin` package.

::: {#lst-sir-det}
```{r, results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
odin_sir <- odin::odin({
  # Derivatives
  deriv(S) <- -beta * S * I
  deriv(I) <- beta * S * I - gamma * I
  deriv(R) <- gamma * I
  deriv(CInc) <- beta * S * I
  
  # Initial conditions
  initial(S) <- S_init
  initial(I) <- I_init
  initial(R) <- R_init
  initial(CInc) <- CInc_init
  
  # Parameters and initial values
  beta <- user(0.004)
  gamma <- user(0.5)
  S_init <- user(999)
  I_init <- user(1)
  R_init <- user(0)
  CInc_init <- user(0)
})

sir_mod <- function(beta, gamma, S0, I0, R0, times) {
  # Set values for a new run
  odin_run <- odin_sir$new(beta = beta, gamma = gamma, S_init = S0, I_init = I0, R_init = R0)
  
  # Run the model
  out <- data.frame(odin_run$run(times))

  # Compute incidence from cumulative incidence
  out$Inc <- c(I0, diff(out$CInc))
  out$CInc <- NULL
  out
}
```

Deterministic SIR model

## Incidence or prevalence

::: callout-important
Be careful of what kind of data we are using to fit the model:

-   **Incidence**: use the $\beta SI$ part.

$$\text{Incidence} = \frac{\text{Number of new cases during a period}}{\text{Population at risk during the same period}}$$

-   **Prevalence**: use the **I compartment**.

$$\text{Prevalence} = \frac{\text{Number of existing cases at time t}}{\text{Total population at time t}}$$
:::

There are two ways to compute incidence.

1.  While writing the differential equations, we tell `odin` to compute the cumulative incidence, then compute the incidence by using `diff()` on the cumulative incidence.

```{r, eval=F}
# Cumulative incidence
deriv(CInc) <- beta * S * I
# Compute incidence from cumulative incidence
out$Inc <- c(I0, diff(out$CInc))
```

2.  In this "closed population", the incidence is the number of individuals moving out of $S$ in each time step. So we can compute it from the $S$ column. Let compare it with the previous method.

```{r}
pred <- sir_mod(beta = 0.004, gamma = 0.5, S0 = 999, I0 = 1, R0 = 0, times = 0:13)

tmp <- pred
tmp$Inc2 <- c(tmp$I[1], -diff(tmp$S))
tmp[,"Inc-Inc2"] <- round(tmp$Inc - tmp$Inc2)
tmp[,c("Inc", "Inc2", "Inc-Inc2")]
```

Now let have a look at the output.

```{r}
head(pred)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| out-width: "100%"
df_plot <- pivot_longer(pred, cols = S:Inc, names_to = "comp", values_to = "n")

ggplot(df_plot, aes(x = t, y = n, color = comp)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "PuOr", breaks = c("S", "Inc", "I", "R")) +
  labs(color = NULL, y = NULL, x = "Time") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The time to peak of incidence is earlier than prevalence:

-   Incidence reflects the immediate rate of new infections, the peak of incidence is reached when the transmission rate begins to decline.
-   Prevalence accumulates both new and existing cases. Even after the incidence starts to decline, the active cases who were infected before the incidence peak are still there waiting for recovering. Prevalence only starts to decline when the recovery rate surpasses the rate of new infections significantly.

::: callout-important

Normally, public health officials are interested in the **incidence** in the general population (to track disease spread) and the **prevalence** in intensive care units (to ensure it does not exceed ICU bed capacity).

## Sensitivity analysis

The effective contact rate $\beta$ and the recovery rate $\gamma$ both affect whether or not there is an epidemic. The total number of people in the population and the initial number of infected people have no effect on whether there is an epidemic.

Below is a function that take a range of values of parameters and compare the model outputs.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
sir_sa <- function(vals, parm, outcome, times, init_beta = 0.004, init_gamma = 0.5) {
  pick_comp <- ifelse(outcome == "prev", "I", "Inc")
  plot_lab <- ifelse(outcome == "prev", "Prevalence", "Incidence")
  symb <- ifelse(parm == "beta", "\u03b2", "\u03b3")
  l <- list()
  for(i in 1:length(vals)) {
    if (parm == "beta") {
      pred <- sir_mod(beta = vals[i], gamma = init_gamma, S0 = 999, I0 = 1, R0 = 0, times = times)[, c("t", pick_comp)]
    } else {
      pred <- sir_mod(beta = init_beta, gamma = vals[i], S0 = 999, I0 = 1, R0 = 0, times = times)[, c("t", pick_comp)]
    }
    pred$comp <- paste0(pick_comp, i)
    colnames(pred) <- c("t", "n", "comp")
    l[[i]] <- pred
  }
  # Bind this list into a data frame
  df_plot <- Reduce(rbind, l)
  # Set level I1 < I2 < I3... according to the increase of beta values
  df_plot$comp <- factor(df_plot$comp, levels = c(paste0(pick_comp, 1:length(vals))))
  
  # Plot results
  my_palette <- brewer.pal(9, "Blues")[(9-length(vals)+1):9]
  
  ggplot(df_plot, aes(x = t, y = n, color = comp)) + 
    geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
    scale_color_manual(values = my_palette, labels = c(paste0(symb, " = ", vals))) +
    labs(color = NULL, y = plot_lab, x = "Time") +
    theme_minimal()
}
```

### Effective contact rate $\beta$

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| out-width: "100%"

vals <- seq(0.001, 0.006, 0.001)

p1 <- sir_sa(vals = vals, parm = "beta", outcome = "prev", times = 0:13) + labs(x = NULL)
p2 <- sir_sa(vals = vals, parm = "beta", outcome = "inc", times = 0:13)

p1 / p2 + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

When $\beta$ **decreases**, less susceptible individuals become infected per unit time:

-   Time until peak ***increases***: because the speed of susceptible individuals become infected is slower.
-   Epidemic duration ***increases***: the rate of new infections slows down so it can lead to a longer epidemic period, but depends on the balance between the infection rate and the recovery rate.
-   Outbreak size **decreases**: $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$, so if $\beta$ decreases, $R_0$ **decreases**, each infected individual infect less people on average.
-   **Lower** epidemic peak: because fewer infections occurring simultaneously.

Interventions that decrease $\beta$ cause a lower outbreak size and a lower epidemic peak. This effect is often referred to as **"flattening the curve"**.

### Recovery rate $\gamma$

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| out-width: "100%"

vals <- seq(0.3, 0.8, 0.1)

p1 <- sir_sa(vals = vals, parm = "gamma", outcome = "prev", times = 0:13) + labs(x = NULL)
p2 <- sir_sa(vals = vals, parm = "gamma", outcome = "inc", times = 0:13)

p1 / p2 + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

When $\gamma$ **decreases**, patients recover more slowly:

-   Outbreak size ***increases***: patients remain infectious for a longer period; since $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$, a decrease in $\gamma$ leads to an increase in $R_0$, meaning each infected individual infects less people on average.
-   ***Higher*** epidemic peak: with a higher $R_0$ more individuals are infected after each generation.
-   Time until peak ***may increases***: the infected population takes longer to clear out due to slower recovery, but the exact timing of the peak also depends on the balance between infection and recovery rates.
-   Epidemic duration ***slightly increases***: for same reason as the peak time, the overall duration of the epidemic is prolonged due to slower recovery rates.

## Corollaries

### The threshold phenomenon

From @eq-sir-di:

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I = I(\beta S - \gamma)$$

The infection "dies out" when:

$$\frac{dI}{dt} < 0 \Leftrightarrow \beta S - \gamma < 0 \Leftrightarrow S < \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$$

> The proportion of susceptibles in the population must exceed this critical threshold $\frac{\gamma}{\beta}$ for an infection to invade [@keeling2011].

The inverse of the relative removal rate is called the basic reproductive ratio $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ [@keeling2011]. See @def-r0 for more details.

### Epidemic burnout

Divide @eq-sir-ds by @eq-sir-dr:

$$\frac{dS}{dR} = \frac{-\beta S I}{\gamma I} = -\frac{\beta}{\gamma} S$$

Upon integrating with respect to R, we obtain:

$$S(t) = S(0)e^{-\frac{\beta}{\gamma} R(t)}$$

Given that $e^x > 0 \quad \forall x$, therefore $S(t) > 0$ there will always be some susceptibles in the population who escape infection, leading to an important counter-intuitive conclusion from this model:

> The chain of transmission eventually breaks due to the decline in infectives, not due to a complete lack of susceptibles [@keeling2011].
