## Model

$$g(Y) = \beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + \dots + f_k(x_k)$$

Splines are a versatile tool for modelling non-linear functions when the exact form of the function is unknown. However, underlying assumptions can lead to either over- or under-fitting. Penalised splines (P-splines) (Eilers and Marx, 1996) seek to avoid over-fitting through the inclusion of discrete penalties on the basis coefficients, though this penalty has no exact interpretation in terms of the functionâ€™s shape. Their Bayesian counterpart however (Lang and Brezger, 2004) offers a statistically robust method of capturing variation in the data whilst also preventing over-fitting through the inclusion of appropriate prior distributions that act on the functional form of the spline [@eales2022].
