## Vaccine effectiveness

::: {#def-vet}
Effectiveness is the **percentage reduction** in the **disease rate** (or **infection risk** [@shim2012]) among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals, similar to efficacy, but in **real-world** conditions [@verani2017].
:::

Vaccine effectiveness is categorized into 4 types:

1.  Direct
2.  Indirect
3.  Total
4.  Overall

Let $R_v$ be the infection risk in the vaccinated group and $R_u$ be the infection risk in the unvaccinated group.

The absolute reduction in infection risk due to vaccination is $R_u - R_v$.

Vaccine efficacy or effectiveness $VE$ is the **percentage reduction** in infection risk, so we divide the absolute reduction by the infection risk of the unvaccinated group.

$$\begin{align} VE &= \frac{R_u - R_v}{R_u} \\ &= 1 - \frac{R_v}{R_u} \\ &= 1 - \text{Relative risk} \end{align}$$

Let have an example:

![](img/vax/trial.png)

-   In the control group, the infection risk is $\frac{4}{8}$ as 4 out of 8 people are infected.
-   In the vaccinated group, the infection risk is $\frac{1}{8}$ as 1 person is infected among 8 people.

$$VE = \frac{\frac{4}{8} - \frac{1}{8}}{\frac{4}{8}} = \frac{4 - 1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$

While 4 people get infected without vaccination, only 1 would get infected if they were vaccinated. The vaccine can prevent 3 of these infections. So the vaccine efficacy is $\frac{3}{4}$ or 75%.

## Measure vaccine effectiveness

### Screening method

1. We have data of all or **a random sample** of disease **cases** over a given period in a population, from which we know the proportion vaccinated ($PCV$) of these cases.

2. We also know the proportion of the **population** vaccinated ($PPV$).

Then the vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) is calculated as:

$$\begin{align} VE &= 1 - \frac{\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}}{\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}} = 1 - \frac{PCV}{1 - PCV} \times \frac{1 - PPV}{PPV} \\
&= \frac{PPV(1 - PCV) - PCV(1 - PPV)}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \\
&= \frac{PPV - PPV \times PCV - PCV + PCV \times PPV}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \\
&= \frac{PPV - PCV}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \end{align}$$

In which:

- $\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}$ is the odd of vaccination in disease cases group.
- $\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}$ is the odd of vaccination in the population.
- $\frac{\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}}{\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}} = \frac{PCV}{1 - PCV} \times \frac{1 - PPV}{PPV}$ is the odds ratio of vaccination between 2 groups (cases vs population).

```{r}
birth_cohort <- c(1980:1986)
cases <- c(82, 98, 180, 177, 112, 140, 151)
vac <- c(5, 9, 28, 37, 22, 27, 27)
cov <- c(70, 70.9, 76, 81, 83.7, 84.5, 83.1)
df <- data.frame(birth_cohort, cases, vac, cov)
df
df$pcv <- df$vac/df$cases
df$ppv <- df$cov / 100
df$rr <- (df$pcv / (1 - df$pcv)) / (df$ppv / (1 - df$ppv))
lm(rr ~ birth_cohort, data = df)
1 - exp(-3.029905)
```

## Vaccine impact

::: {#def-vi}
Impact quantifies the reduction in **disease rate** (either percentage decline or absolute change in disease rate) at the **population level** after vaccine introduction. It is determined by: (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine coverage and (3) herd immunity [@verani2017].
