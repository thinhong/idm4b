# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book brings together everything I have learned about infectious disease modelling during my PhD journey. Special thanks to my idol, [Dr. James Hay](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/james-a-hay), who once gave these genius advice:

> "Read and learn now - it will be harder later on."
>
> "Spent a lot of time writing well-documented, generalisable code that didn't necessarily turn into publications at the time. I now use that code **all of the time**."
>
> Dr. James Hay's inspiring talk at the MIDSEA ECR April 2024 Meeting.

These words encouraged me to read and learn more, and to ensure every detail was carefully documented. In this book, you (and my future self) will find:

- A dictionary of jargon with cited definitions.
- Methodologies for mathematical models of infectious diseases.
- Step-by-step guides for writing infectious disease reports, following the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report format: data, workflow, analyses, and inference.
