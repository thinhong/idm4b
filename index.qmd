## Modelling

A model is a simplified representation of a complex phenomenon [@vynnycky2010].

We all use models in our daily lives, often without realizing it. Imagine a colleague asks, "How long will it take to get to the restaurant?". There are different ways you might answer this question, each reflecting a different "model" in your head:

- Experience-based model: You might think, "Last week it took me 20 minutes to get to this restaurant". This model simplifies by assuming past experiences are a reliable predictor of future outcomes, ignoring daily variations like traffic or weather.

- Distance and speed model: You might think, "The restaurant is 15 kilometers away, and I drive at 45 km/h, so it should take about 20 minutes". This model uses the formula $\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}$. It simplifies by assuming a constant speed, and not accounting for real-world complexities like traffic lights or congestion.

Models help us navigate and make decisions about complex situations by focusing on the most relevant factors and ignoring the less critical details.
