## Force of infection

Recall from the SIR model @sec-sir-mod, that the rate of transition from $S$ to $I$, $\lambda = \beta I$, is called the **force of infection** (FOI). The FOI represents the risk of a susceptible individual becoming infected over a given period of time.

## Serocatalytic models

Serocatalytic models provide a simple framework: the population is divided into two groups seronegative ($N$) and seropositive ($P$). Assuming no seroreversion, individuals transition from $N$ to $P$ at a rate $\lambda$, which is equivalent to the FOI.

The term "catalytic model" comes from its analogy to a chemical reaction, where reagent $N$ is transformed into reagent $P$ at a rate $\lambda$.

The FOI can either be constant $\lambda$ or vary over time $\lambda(t)$.

### Constant FOI

Consider a cohort where we track seroprevalence over time (i.e., we observe $P(t)$). The system can be described by the following differential equations:

$$\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\lambda N(t)$$

$$\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \lambda N(t)$$

In which $N(t) + P(t) = 1$ or $N(t) = 1 - P(t)$. We can rewrite the latter equation as:

$$\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \lambda(1 - P(t))$$

We can solve $P$ analytically as:

$$P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$$ {#eq-serocat-mod}

## Proof

$$\begin{align}
P(t) &= 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \Leftrightarrow e^{-\lambda t} = (1 - P(t)) \\
P(t) &= 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \\
\Leftrightarrow \frac{dP(t)}{dt} &= -(-\lambda)e^{-\lambda t} \\
&= \lambda e^{-\lambda t} \\
&= \lambda (1 - P(t))
\end{align}$$

### Constant FOI (endemic model)

In a population where a disease is at endemic equilibrium without vaccination, seronegative ($N$) and seropositive ($P$) remain constant over time (because it is equilibrium). However, these proportions vary with age. By replacing the time term in @eq-serocat-mod with age, we can express the seropositive $P(a)$ as a function of age:

$$P(a) = 1 - e^{-\lambda a}$$

### Time-varying FOI

FOI is a function of time $\lambda(t)$. Then @eq-serocat-mod become:

$$\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \lambda(t)(1 - P(t))$$

We can solve $P$ analytically as:

$$P = 1 - (1 - P_0) e^{-\int_0^t \lambda(u) du}$$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Proof

$$\begin{align}
\frac{dP}{dt} &= \lambda(t)(1 - P) \\
\Leftrightarrow \frac{dP}{1 - P} &= \lambda(t)dt
\end{align}$$

Now integrate both sides:

$$\begin{align}
\int \frac{dP}{1 - P} &= \int \lambda(t)dt \\
\Leftrightarrow -\log(1 - P) &= \int \lambda(t)dt + C \\
\Leftrightarrow \log(1 - P) &= -\int \lambda(t)dt - C
\end{align}$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides:

$$1 - P = e^{-\int \lambda(t)dt - C}$$

Simplifying further:

$$1 - P = A e^{-\int \lambda(t) dt}$$

where $A = e^{-C}$ is a constant determined by initial conditions. Solving for $P$:

$$P = 1 - A e^{-\int \lambda(t) dt}$$

If the initial condition is $P(0) = P_0$, substitute $t = 0$ into the solution:

$$P_0 = 1 - A e^0 = 1 - A$$

Thus, $A = 1 - P_0$, and the final solution is:

$$P = 1 - (1 - P_0) e^{-\int_0^t \lambda(u) du}$$
:::

Usually we assume $P_0 = 0$ (the population is fully susceptible or seronegative at the beginning $t = 0$), so:

$$P(t) = 1 - e^{-\int_0^t \lambda(u) du}$$

### Time-varying FOI across different ages

When the sample includes individuals of different ages, the seroprevalence $P(a, t)$ depends on both the individual's age $a$ and the calendar time $t$.

$$P(a, t) = 1 - e^{-\int_{t - a}^t \lambda(u) du}$$

where $\int_{t - a}^t \lambda(u)$ represents the cumulative FOI experienced by an individual from birth $t - a$ up to the current time $t$.

### Seroreversion

If individuals lose immunity over time (waning immunity) with a constant rate $\rho$.
