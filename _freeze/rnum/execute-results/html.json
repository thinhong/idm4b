In short, $R_0$ is the $R$ in a fully susceptible population, the **maximum** $R$ in a population.\n:::\n\nThe basic reproduction number is sometimes called the *basic reproductive number* or *basic reproductive ratio* [@vandendriessche2017].\n\n## Effective reproduction number $R_e$\n\n::: {#def-re}\n$R_e$ is the average number of secondary cases generated by each infectious individual throughout their infectious period in a population where **not all individuals are susceptible**.\n:::\n\nLet $s$ be the proportion of the population that is susceptible.\n\n$$R_e = s \\times R_0$$\n\n## Effective reproduction number at time $t$ $R_t$\n\n::: {#def-rt}\n$R_e(t)$ [@knight2020] or $R_t$ is the average number of **secondary cases** generated by one infected person **at time** $t$ during the outbreak.\n:::\n\nA public health control strategy will end an outbreak if it can keep $R_t$ below 1. The level of immunity at which $R_t = 1$ is the herd immunity threshold [@vegvari2022].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rnum_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.svg){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAt the beginning of an outbreak, we can estimate $R_0$ when the whole population is fully susceptible. As the outbreak progresses, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, leading to a decline in $R_0$. This adjusted value is referred to as $R_t$ (if we want to measure at each time $t$). At the peak of the epidemic curve, $R_t = 1$. After this peak, $R_t$ continues to decrease, resulting in a decline in the number of new cases and the epidemic curve going down.\n\n$R_t$ can be defined in 2 ways: as the **instantaneous reproduction number** or as the **case reproduction number** [@gostic2020].\n\n### Instantaneous reproduction number $R_t^i$ {#sec-rt-inst}\n\n![](img/rnum/rt-inst.png)\n\n> Figure illustrates the Cori method [@gostic2020].\n\nMeasures transmission at a specific point in time [@gostic2020]. The instantaneous reproduction number quantifies the number of new infections at a single point in time $t_i$ (blue arrow), using the number of infections in the previous generation (green arrows) and their current infectiousness (green curve) [@gostic2020]. The analyses can be done **near real-time**.\n\nMethods to estimate instantaneous reproduction number includes Cori and colleagues [@cori2013] (the best for near real-time estimation [@gostic2020]), and Bettencourt and Ribeiro [@bettencourt2008] (use with caution because they implicitly assume the generation interval follows an exponential distribution, as in SIR model, which does not include alatent period).\n\n### Case reproduction number $R_t^c$ {#sec-rt-case}\n\n![](img/rnum/rt-case.png)\n\n> Figure illustrates the Wallinga and Teunis method [@gostic2020].\n\nMeasures transmission by a specific cohort of individuals [@gostic2020]. A cohort is a group of individuals with the **same date of infection** or the **same date of symptom onset**. The case reproduction number is the average number of new infections that an individual who becomes infected on day $t_i$ (green arrows in B) or symptomatic on day $t_s$ (yellow arrows in C) will eventually go on to cause (blue downward arrows in B and C). It is a more natural choice for analyses that consider heterogeneity among individuals [@gostic2020].\n\nMethods to estimate instantaneous reproduction number includes Wallinga and Teunis method [@wallinga2004].\n\n## Growth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$\n\nGrowth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$ are basically the same. $r$ is used in continuous time and $R$ is used in discrete time.\n\n### Growth rate $r$\n\nThe rate at which new cases are arising [@anderson2020]. It can be a positive number (new infections is increasing) or a negative number (new infections is decreasing).\n\nThe number of new infections at an increasing or decreasing exponential rate. It is dependent on the reproduction number and timescale between infections.\n\n$$\\frac{d_\\text{newCases}}{dt}$$\n",
