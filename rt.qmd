# Estimating $R_t$

## Methods

$R_t$ can be defined in 2 ways: as the **instantaneous reproduction number** (see @sec-rt-inst) or as the **case reproduction number** (see @sec-rt-case).

### Instantaneous reproduction number $R_t^i$

::: {#def-rt-inst}
The instantaneous reproduction number is the expected number of secondary infections occurring at time $t$, divided by the number of infected individuals, each scaled by their relative infectiousness at time $t$ (an individual’s relative infectiousness is based on the generation interval and time since infection) [@gostic2020].
:::

#### Exact calculation

For a compartmental model (SIR or SEIR), $R_t^i$ can be calculated exactly as [@gostic2020]:

$$R_t^i = \beta(t) S(t) D$$

-   $\beta(t)$: the time-varying transmission rate.
-   $S(t)$: the fraction of the population that is susceptible.
-   $D$: the mean duration of infectiousness.

#### Cori method {#sec-cori}

$$R_t^i = \frac{I_t}{\sum_{s = 1}^{t} I_{t - s} w_s}$$

-   $I_t$: the number of infection on day $t$.
-   $I_{t - s}$: the number of individuals who became infected $s$ days in the past.
-   $w_s$: the infectivity profile, describes how infectious an individual is $s$ days since infection, $w_s$ dependent on time since infection $s$ but independent of calendar time $t$, and often be approximated by the generation interval [@cori2013].
-   $I_{t - s} w_s$: we scale the number of individuals who became infected $s$ days in the past by how infectiousness are they still on day $t$ (which is $s$ days after the date they got infected, $w_s$).

Looking back at @def-rt-inst, $R_t^i$ is the expected number of secondary infections occurring at time $t$ ($I_t$), divided by the number of infected individuals ($\sum_{s = 1}^{t} I_{t - s}$), each scaled by their relative infectiousness at time $t$ ($w_s$).

The only parametric assumption required by this method is **the form of the generation interval**. The standard assumption is that $w_s$ follows a **discretized gamma distribution**, but any parametric or empirical discrete distribution also work [@gostic2020].

#### When can we start estimating $R_t^i$?

Cori et al. suggest starting estimating $R_t^i$ once those three criteria are fulfilled [@cori2013]:

- At least after the sliding window size.
- At least after one mean serial interval.
- At least 12 cases have been observed since the beginning of the epidemic: because to get a posterior credible interval of 0.3, the time window considered must comprise at least 11 incident cases.

#### Key considerations

Source: Dr. Anne Cori's [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv3BecZD5DU).

- Temporal resolution: we can't apply the $R_t^i$ method when the time steps of observation is too large (> mean generation interval).
- Spatial resolution: ideally use a spatial scale that you can distinguish locally infected cases from imported cases.
- $R_t^i$ is very sensitive to the size of the sliding window: small windows can lead to highly variable estimates with wide credible intervals, whereas longer windows lead to smoothed estimates with narrower credible intervals.

### Case reproduction number $R_t^c$

::: {#def-rt-case}
The case or cohort reproduction number is the expected number of secondary infections that an individual who becomes infected at time $t$ will eventually cause as they progress through their infection.
:::

#### Exact calculation

$$R_t^c = \int_{u = t}^{\infty} R_u^i w_{u-t} du$$

-   $R_u^i$: the instantaneous reproduction number of current infected cases at time $u$, starting from $t$ to the end of their infectious period $\infty$.
-   $w_{u-t}$: the infectiousness of them at that time.

#### Wallinga and Teunis method

There are 3 steps [@gostic2020]:

**Step 1**. Estimate the likelihood that case $j$ (infected at time $t_j$) infected case $i$ (at time $t_i$).

$$p_{ij} = \frac{w_{t_i - t_j}}{\sum_{i \neq k} w_{t_i - t_k}}$$

-   $\sum_{i \neq k} w_{t_i - t_k}$: sum of the infectiousness of all cases (other than $i$) infects case $i$.

**Step 2**. Compute the individual reproduction number of case $j$.

$$R_j = \sum_i p_{ij}$$

**Step 3**. Compute the case reproduction number at time $t$, it is the expected value of $R_j$ for all individuals infected at time $t$.

$$R_t^c = \mathbb{E}(R_j)$$

## Proofs

The renewal equation is a cornerstone of demographic theory and backbone of the $R_t$ estimators.

$$b(t) = \int_{a = 0}^{\infty} b(t - a) n(a) da$$

-   $b(t)$: the number of births at time $t$.
-   $b(t - a)$: the number of birth at time $t - a$, or the number of people of age $a$ at time $t$.
-   $n(a)$: the birth ability of people of age $a$, scaled by the probability of surviving to age $a$.

To describe epidemic dynamics, the renewal equation is expressed in terms of $I(t)$.

$$I(t) = R_0 S(t) \int_{s = 0}^{\infty} I(t - s) w_s ds$$

-   $R_0 S(t) = R_t$: see @def-rt.
-   $I(t - s)$: the number of individuals who became infected $s$ time points ago in the past.
-   $w_s$: the infectivity profile, or the probability of how infectiousness are they still at time $t$ (which is $s$ time points after the date they got infected),
-   $I(t - s) w_s$: we scale the number of individuals who in the past by how infectiousness are they still at time $t$.

Now we transform the equation a bit, and we got something very similar to the Cori method (see @sec-cori).

$$R_t = \frac{I(t)}{\int_{s = 0}^{\infty} I(t - s) w_s ds}$$

## Potential biases

$R_t$ is a **value** in specific **time**, therefore there are 2 potential forms of bias in $R_t$ estimates [@gostic2020]:

-   **Accuracy** (the value): Systematic over- or underestimation caused by misspecification of the generation interval. Mostly impact when $R_t$ is substantially \> 1 (e.g., the beginning of COVID-19 when $R_t$ is relatively high) or \< 1 (e.g., after a very effective intervention then $R_t$ might be low).

-   **Timeliness** (the time): Temporal inaccuracy that $R_t$ estimates may be leading or lagging the true date, has several possible causes and can be difficult to avoid.

### Generation interval

::: {#def-gen-int}
Generation interval is the time from the infection of a primary case to infection of the cases he/she generates [@cori2013].
:::

If we match this to an SEIR model, the generation interval starts when the infector enters the E compartment (meaning they got infected). The latest time they can infect an infectee is at the end of their residence in the I compartment (they are infectious). Therefore, generation interval is the sum of residence times in compartments E and I [@gostic2020].

The mean generation interval **decreases** when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from **multiple sources**. Because when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a "race" to infect him/her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection [@kenah2008].

### Serial interval

::: {#def-ser-int}
Serial interval is the time between symptom onset in an infector–infectee pair [@gostic2020].
:::

The distributions of the serial interval and the generation interval are identical in these scenarios [@cori2013]:

-   For diseases such as influenza, SARS, measles, and smallpox, it is expected that infectiousness starts only around the time of symptom onset.
-   When the infectiousness profile after symptoms is independent of the incubation period.
