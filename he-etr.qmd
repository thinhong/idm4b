## Overview {.unnumbered}

Health economics is closely linked to policy. Understanding how policies are made (in a proper way) helps us design studies that can contribute to policy-making. It is also useful to put yourself in the role of policy makers to consider how your research can best benefit the public.

Evidence to Recommendation Process (EtR Process) is a systematic, standardized decision-making process used by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) for the development of evidence-based **recommendations** for **immunization policy**. EtR Process is composed of four steps:

1.  The policy question
2.  The elements to consider
3.  The evidence
4.  The recommendation

Steps 1, 2 and 3 should be conducted by the NITAG Secretariat or a working group. In step 4, all NITAG members should be involved.

## Prerequisite step {.unnumbered}

When using the EtR Process for the first time, a **prerequisite step** should be conducted by **the whole NITAG** to develop 2 tools:

-   Generic criteria tables
-   EtR framework

Noted that this step **only** needs to be conducted **once**.

### Generic criteria tables {.unnumbered}

Generic criteria tables comprise **7 tables** that contain **all issues** relevant for **any** immunization policy **question**, **unspecific** to any particular disease or vaccine. Each table links a **criterion** with many factors. Each **factor** then has many **elements**, each representing a type of evidence needed for for NITAG consideration.

+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Criterion    | Factor                         | Element                                          |
+==============+================================+==================================================+
| Problem      | Burden/epidemiology of disease | Frequency of the disease (incidence, prevalence) |
|              |                                |                                                  |
|              |                                | Severity of the disease (mortality, morbidity)   |

### EtR framework {.unnumbered}

EtR framework is a structured document that shows the **logical progression** from the evidence to the decision. EtR framework has 3 main sections:

1.  Introduction: presents the policy question.
2.  Criteria: presents 7 criteria, factors and elements from the generic criteria tables, with evidence and notes.
3.  Draft NITAG recommendation: presents the draft NITAG decision.

## The policy question

An initial policy question can be either raised by the Ministry of Health to NITAG, or by NITAG itself. The initial policy question is usually rather broad, for example:

-   Should vaccine X be introduced in a routine vaccination programme?
-   Should the schedule of vaccine X be reviewed?

This step is to **revise** the broad question into a **structured** policy question that detailed enough to guide the collection of evidence. A structured policy question should has:

-   **Intervention**: The vaccine formulation, dosage and schedule.
-   **Population**: The population targeted to receive the vaccine and/or will be affected by it.
-   **Goal** of intervention: The outcome of interest, could be measurable (e.g. reduction of a certain disease) or not.
-   **Comparison**: If compares a new intervention to an existing one.
-   **Options**: If several options are available (e.g. different vaccine formulations, dosages or schedules).

## The elements to consider

This step is to create **specific** criteria tables from the generic criteria tables. It includes 2 steps:

-   **Make the elements specific**: Specify the disease, intervention and population of interest for all elements in the generic criteria tables.
-   **Select the factors and specified elements** relevant for the policy question: After specifying the elements, pick the relevant factors and specified elements, and place them in the EtR framework.

## The evidence

This step is to collect **evidence** on the selected factors and specified elements determined in Step 2, rate the evidence quality, and put them in the EtR framework. It is **the most labour-intensive** part.

Evidence may be obtained from literature (published or unpublished), statistical data, surveillance records, experiences from countries that have already implemented the intervention, documents/publications and/or recommendations from WHO, WHO SAGE, Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Groups such as the European Technical Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization or other NITAGs.

Criterion 2 "**Benefits and harms** of the intervention" is extremely important, therefore:

-   Some NITAGs conduct systematic review, which is very time and resource consuming and should only be done if necessary capacities are available.
-   Use GRADE quality assessments to assess the evidence **quality**, which is the **confidence** level in how close the reported effects in the evidence are to the true effects.

Lower quality data does not prevent recommendations, but the limitations should be clearly outlined.

## The recommendation

In this step, the Secretariat or working group draft NITAG **decision** and **recommendation**, and present to all NITAG members. The whole NITAG should discuss and agree on a final NITAG decision and recommendation.

## Excercise {.unnumbered}

**Step 1. The policy question**

> Should flu vaccine be introduced in a routine vaccination programme?

Make a structured policy question that include:

-   Intervention
-   Population
-   Goal

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Sample answer

**Intervention**: Influenza vaccine VaxiGrip Tetra, single dose of 0.5 mL.

**Population**:

-   In PH (relatively younger population, median = 25 years old)
-   People with high contacts with animals
-   Vets, slaughterhouse workers, farmers, retailers
-   Young (aged 6 months to 4 years)
-   Old (aged 55 years old and above)
-   Pregnant women
-   Immunocompromised

**Goal**:

-   Preventing spillover infections (animals to human with new variants, which may cause pandemic)
-   Reducing hospitalization rate and mortality rate
-   Preventing infection
-   Reduced severe cases needing of hospitalization
-   Protecting others
-   Maximise vaccine coverage
