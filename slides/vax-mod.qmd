## 2 decisions

To model vaccination, we need to decide 2 things:

1.  What is the vaccine effect? Does it protect against infection, severe disease, transmission, or a combination?

2.  How do we model imperfect protection?

# Vaccine effect

## Prevent infection

Vaccine prevents the pathogen from establishing an infection in the body. A vaccinated person is less likely to get infected.

## Prevent infection

Assuming a perfect vaccine against infection, the model can be designed as follows:

![](../img/vax/prv-inf-mod.svg)

Vaccinated people $V$ remain uninfected in their lifetime and do not participate in disease transmission.

## Prevent infection

You can simplify this model by moving susceptible people to the $R$ compartment because they also do not participate in disease transmission.

## Prevent severe disease

A vaccinated individual still get infected but experiences a much milder form of the disease.

## Prevent severe disease

Assuming a perfect vaccine against severe disease, the model can be designed as follows:

## Prevent transmission

A vaccinated person still get infected, still get sick, but they are less likely to spread the disease to others.

## Prevent transmission

Assuming a perfect vaccine against transmission, the model can be designed as follows:

$I$ being the only source of infection that contributes to the force of infection. Vaccinated people $S_v$ still get infected and become $I_v$, but they do not transmit the disease.

# Imperfect protections

What is meant by a vaccine with effectiveness of 80%?

## All-or-nothing model

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**All-or-nothing** (AoN, also called the **polarized** [@park2023], or **take**) model assumes that **among vaccinated** individuals, a **proportion** $VE_P$ are **completely protected**, while **the remaining fraction** $1 - VE_P$ remains **completely unprotected** [@zachreson2023; @park2023].
:::

An effectiveness of 80% here implies that among vaccinated people, 80% are completely protected, and 20% receive no protection [@worldhealthorganization2013].

## Leaky model

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**Leaky** (or **degree**) model assumes that **all vaccinated** individuals **are partially protected** [@zachreson2023].
:::

An effectiveness of 80% here implies that all vaccinated people have the endpoint of interest reduced by 80% compared to non-vaccinees.

## Leaky model

The assumption that no vaccinated people is totally or permanently protected implies one or both of the following [@worldhealthorganization2013]:

-   No amount (titre) of the immune marker is totally protective or, if it is, no individual can maintain that titre for a long period (because of waning or transient immunosuppression)
-   The degree of protection is a function of the level of the immune marker - the simplest explanation being that protection is a function of both the level of the immune marker and the challenge dose.

## Leaky model

## Mixed effects

Imperfect vaccines often have a combination of effects: they can protect against infection, severe disease, and transmission at the same time.

## Mixed effects

Assuming a vaccine with leaky effectiveness $VE_L$ against infection and severe disease, the model can be designed as follows:

## Multiple doses

Some vaccines require multiple doses. Below is the DynaMICE model [@verguet2015] for the 2-dose measles vaccine, assuming AoN effectiveness for both doses.
