## Differentiation

## Integral



## Partial derivative

A partial derivative measures how a function with multiple variables changes when you vary only one of those variables and keep the others fixed.

For example, to compute:

$$\frac{\partial(a^2 + b^2)}{\partial a}$$

- Treat $b$ as if it were a constant.
- Since $b^2$ is a constant with respect to $a$, its derivative is 0.
- Take the derivative of $a^2$ with respect to $a$, which is $2a$.

Hence:

$$\frac{\partial(a^2 + b^2)}{\partial a} = 2a$$
