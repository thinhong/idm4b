Reproduction number $R$ is the ***average*** number of ***secondary infections*** caused by ***an average infected*** person throughout their ***infectious period*** [@vegvari2022].

## Basic reproduction number $R_0$

$R_0$ (pronounced /R naught/) is the average number of secondary cases generated by an average infected person throughout their infectious period in a ***fully susceptible population*** [@anderson2020]. In short, $R_0$ is the $R$ in a fully susceptible population, the ***maximum*** $R$ in a population.

## Effective reproduction number $R_e$

$R_e$ is the average number of secondary cases generated by an average infected person throughout their infectious period in a population where ***not all individuals are susceptible***.

Let $s$ be the proportion of the population that is susceptible.

$$R_e = s \times R_0$$

## Effective reproduction number at time $t$ $R_t$

$R_e(t)$ [@knight2020] or $R_t$ is the average number of ***secondary cases*** generated by one infected person ***at time*** $t$ during the outbreak.

A public health control strategy will end an outbreak if it can keep $R_t$ below 1. The level of immunity at which $R_t = 1$ is the herd immunity threshold [@vegvari2022].

df <- readRDS("data/rnum-plot.rds")
tmp <- plot(df)

p1 <- tmp[[2]] + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-03-20")) + labs(y = "New infections", tag = NULL)

p2 <- tmp[[3]] + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-03-20")) + annotate("text", x = as.Date("2020-02-22"), y = 2.15, label = expression("R"["0"])) + labs(y = expression("R"["t"]), x = NULL, tag = NULL)

p1 / p2
```

At the beginning of an outbreak, we can estimate $R_0$ when the whole population is fully susceptible. As the outbreak progresses, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, leading to a decline in $R_0$. This adjusted value is referred to as $R_t$ (if we want to measure at each time $t$). At the peak of the epidemic curve, $R_t = 1$. After this peak, $R_t$ continues to decrease, resulting in a decline in the number of new cases and the epidemic curve going down.

## Growth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$

Growth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$ are basically the same. $r$ is used in continuous time and $R$ is used in discrete time.

### Growth rate $r$

The rate at which new cases are arising [@anderson2020]. It can be a positive number (new infections is increasing) or a negative number (new infections is decreasing).

The number of new infections at an increasing or decreasing exponential rate. It is dependent on the reproduction number and timescale between infections.
