Reproduction number $R$ is the **average** number of **secondary infections** caused by **an average infected** person throughout their **infectious period** [@vegvari2022].

## Basic reproduction number $R_0$

::: {#def-r0}
$R_0$ (pronounced /R naught/) is the average number of secondary cases generated by an average infected person throughout their infectious period in a **fully susceptible population** [@anderson2020]. In short, $R_0$ is the $R$ in a fully susceptible population, the **maximum** $R$ in a population.
:::

## Effective reproduction number $R_e$

::: {#def-re}
$R_e$ is the average number of secondary cases generated by an average infected person throughout their infectious period in a population where **not all individuals are susceptible**.
:::

Let $s$ be the proportion of the population that is susceptible.

$$R_e = s \times R_0$$

## Effective reproduction number at time $t$ $R_t$

::: {#def-rt}
$R_e(t)$ [@knight2020] or $R_t$ is the average number of **secondary cases** generated by one infected person **at time** $t$ during the outbreak.
:::

A public health control strategy will end an outbreak if it can keep $R_t$ below 1. The level of immunity at which $R_t = 1$ is the herd immunity threshold [@vegvari2022].

df <- readRDS("data/rnum-plot.rds")
tmp <- plot(df)

p1 <- tmp[[2]] + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-03-20")) + labs(y = "New infections", tag = NULL)

p2 <- tmp[[3]] + geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-03-20")) + annotate("text", x = as.Date("2020-02-22"), y = 2.15, label = expression("R"["0"])) + labs(y = expression("R"["t"]), x = NULL, tag = NULL)

p1 / p2
```

At the beginning of an outbreak, we can estimate $R_0$ when the whole population is fully susceptible. As the outbreak progresses, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, leading to a decline in $R_0$. This adjusted value is referred to as $R_t$ (if we want to measure at each time $t$). At the peak of the epidemic curve, $R_t = 1$. After this peak, $R_t$ continues to decrease, resulting in a decline in the number of new cases and the epidemic curve going down.

$R_t$ can be defined in 2 ways: as the **instantaneous reproduction number** or as the **case reproduction number** [@gostic2020].

### Instantaneous reproduction number $R_t^i$ {#sec-rt-inst}

![](img/rnum/rt-inst.png)

> Figure illustrates the Cori method [@gostic2020].

Measures transmission at a specific point in time [@gostic2020]. The instantaneous reproduction number quantifies the number of new infections at a single point in time $t_i$ (blue arrow), using the number of infections in the previous generation (green arrows) and their current infectiousness (green curve) [@gostic2020]. The analyses can be done **near real-time**.

Methods to estimate instantaneous reproduction number includes Cori and colleagues [@cori2013] (the best for near real-time estimation [@gostic2020]), and Bettencourt and Ribeiro [@bettencourt2008] (use with caution because they implicitly assume the generation interval follows an exponential distribution, as in SIR model, which does not include alatent period).

### Case reproduction number $R_t^c$ {#sec-rt-case}

![](img/rnum/rt-case.png)

> Figure illustrates the Wallinga and Teunis method [@gostic2020].

Measures transmission by a specific cohort of individuals [@gostic2020]. A cohort is a group of individuals with the **same date of infection** or the **same date of symptom onset**. The case reproduction number is the average number of new infections that an individual who becomes infected on day $t_i$ (green arrows in B) or symptomatic on day $t_s$ (yellow arrows in C) will eventually go on to cause (blue downward arrows in B and C). It is a more natural choice for analyses that consider heterogeneity among individuals [@gostic2020].

Methods to estimate instantaneous reproduction number includes Wallinga and Teunis method [@wallinga2004].

### Compare $R_t^i$ and $R_t^c$

There are several important differences [@gostic2020]:

1. Instantaneous $R_t^i$ is real-time estimation and only use data from before time $t$, while case $R_t^c$ is inherently forward-looking.

- **Instantaneous $R_t^i$ overestimates $R_t$ early** in the time series, because any infections that occurred before the first observed date are missing terms in the denominator (data is left-truncated at the beginning).

- **Case $R_t^c$ underestimates $R_t$ at the end** of the time series, because it relies on time points not yet observed which become missing terms in the production (data is right-truncated at the end).

2. Case $R_t^c$ is shifted forward in time relative to instantaneous $R_t^i$, produces leading estimates of $R_t$ because it uses data from time points **after $t$**, whereas the $R_t^i$ uses data from time points **before $t$**.

::: {.callout-important}
Overall, **for real-time analyses** aiming to **infer the impact of changes in policy**, behavior, or other extrinsic factors on transmission, the **instantaneous reproductive number** will provide more temporally accurate estimates and is **most appropriate**.

## Growth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$

Growth rate $r$ and reproduction number $R$ are basically the same. $r$ is used in continuous time and $R$ is used in discrete time.

### Growth rate $r$

The rate at which new cases are arising [@anderson2020]. It can be a positive number (new infections is increasing) or a negative number (new infections is decreasing).

The number of new infections at an increasing or decreasing exponential rate. It is dependent on the reproduction number and timescale between infections.
