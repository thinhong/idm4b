## What is a model?

A model is a simplified representation of a complex phenomenon [@vynnycky2010].

We all use models in our daily lives, often without realizing it. Imagine a colleague asks, "How long will it take to get to the restaurant?". There are different ways you might answer this question, each reflecting a different "model" in your head:

-   Experience-based model: You might think, "Last week it took me 20 minutes to get to this restaurant". This model simplifies by assuming past experiences are a reliable predictor of future outcomes, ignoring daily variations like traffic or weather.

-   Distance and speed model: You might think, "The restaurant is 15 kilometers away, and I drive at 45 km/h, so it should take about 20 minutes". This model uses the formula $\text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}$. It simplifies by assuming a constant speed, and not accounting for real-world complexities like traffic lights or congestion.

Models help us navigate and make decisions about complex situations by focusing on the most relevant factors and ignoring the less critical details.

## There is no perfect model

> -   Models will always be an approximation, and rare or unforeseen behavioural events can have a significant impact on the disease dynamics

## Types of model

### Static vs dynamic

A **static** model is one where **time does not affect** its operation. Time may be present but does not influence the model's structure or function [@smith2023]. In infectious disease modelling, static model assumes that the force of infection is constant or changes only as a function of age and other individual characteristics (**not time**) [@handbook2023].

A **dynamic** model is one where **time is essential** to its operation. The model cannot function without representing time [@smith2023]. In infectious disease modelling, dynamic model assumes that the force of infection can vary throughout the course of **time** and as a function of population interactions, often in non-linear ways [@handbook2023].

### Dynamic continuous-change vs discrete-change

**Dynamic models** use **state variables** to describe the system's status at any point in time. If the state variables can change **continuously over continuous time**, then the model has continuous-change aspects. 

### Deterministic vs stochastic

A **deterministic** model assumes that there is **no randomness**, and the system can be fully described by a defined set of equations and parameters. **Each run** of the deterministic model **always** generates the **same result** [@handbook2023].

A **stochastic** model assumes events occur **randomly**, affecting single parameters or multiple components within the system. **Each run** of a stochastic model generates **different results**. Therefore, stochastic models must be run for hundreds or thousands of iterations to explore the full range of possible outcomes [@handbook2023].

## Solving a model

Solving a model means finding a function that satisfies the given conditions. Consider the Malthusian growth model as an example:

$$\frac{dP}{dt} = rP$$

-   $r$: the growth rate.
-   $P$: the population size.

Solving this model means to write a function of $P$ that satisfies the derivative. This model can be solved analytically by:

$$\begin{align} \frac{dP}{dt} & = rP \\
\Leftrightarrow \frac{dP}{P} & = rdt \\
\Leftrightarrow \int \frac{dP}{P} & = \int rdt \\
\Leftrightarrow \log P & = rt + C \\
\Leftrightarrow P & = e^{rt + C} \end{align}$$

where $C$ is the constant of integration.
