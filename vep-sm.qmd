# Screening method

1. We have data of all or **a random sample** of disease **cases** over a given period in a population, from which we know the proportion vaccinated ($PCV$) of these cases.

2. We also know the proportion of the **population** vaccinated ($PPV$).

Then the vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) is calculated as:

$$\begin{align} VE &= 1 - \frac{\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}}{\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}} = 1 - \frac{PCV}{1 - PCV} \times \frac{1 - PPV}{PPV} \\
&= \frac{PPV(1 - PCV) - PCV(1 - PPV)}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \\
&= \frac{PPV - PPV \times PCV - PCV + PCV \times PPV}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \\
&= \frac{PPV - PCV}{PPV(1 - PCV)} \end{align}$$

In which:

- $\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}$ is the odd of vaccination in disease cases group.
- $\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}$ is the odd of vaccination in the population.
- $\frac{\frac{PCV}{1 - PCV}}{\frac{PPV}{1 - PPV}} = \frac{PCV}{1 - PCV} \times \frac{1 - PPV}{PPV}$ is the odds ratio of vaccination between 2 groups (cases vs population).
