## Types of health economic analyses

**Partial** economic evaluations: studies that either **only** examine **cost or consequences**, or examine both costs and consequences but for only one intervention (**without a comparator**). This analysis **cannot** guide decision-making [@turner2021].

**Full** economic evaluations: compare **both** the **costs and consequences** of the intervention to a **comparator**. There are 3 most popular types of full economic evaluations, the key difference lies in how they express the **consequences** [@turner2021]:

| Type               | Costs | Consequences                                                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Cost-effectiveness | \$    | A single natural unit (life-years gained, cases averted, cases detected) |
| Cost-utility       | \$    | QALYs, DALYs                                                             |
| Cost-benefit       | \$    | \$                                                                       |
: {tbl-colwidths="[30,20,50]"}

::: callout-note
-   Cost-utility is sometimes considered as a special type of cost-effectiveness.
-   There are 2 more types of full economic evaluations: cost-minimisation and cost-consequence, but they are less commonly used.
