::: {#def-micsim}
Microsimulation: an analysis in which individual instantiations of a system - such as a patient's lifetime or the course of an epidemic - are generated using a random process to 'draw' from probability distributions a large number of times, in order to examine the central tendency and possibly the distribution of outcomes [@kim2008].

::: {#def-iid}
iid (**independent** and **identically distributed** random variables): each random variable has the **same probability distribution** as the others and **all** are **mutually independent**.

::: {#def-closedform-sol}
**Closed-form solution** (or closed form expression) is any formula that can be evaluated in a finite number of standard operations ([source](https://riskencyclopedia.com/articles/closed_form_solution/)).

infection fatality ratio (IFR) and case fatality ratio (CFR) and serology data.

::: {#def-residual}
**Residual**: is the difference between the observed value and the **estimated** value.
:::

::: {#def-error}
**Error**: is the deviation of the observed value from the **true** value.

Matrix and linear transformation:

-   Linear transformation is a function (transformation = function) that take in a vector and spit out a vector.
-   Lines remain lines, and origin remains fixed.

::: {#def-inv-matrix}
Inverse matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}$$
