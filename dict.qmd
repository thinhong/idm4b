# Dictionary

Epidemic is "the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time" (US-CDC) [@texier2016]. Epidemic is derived from the Greek *epi* and *demos* meaning "that which is upon the people", to describe the burden of some phenomenon on "the people" [@nelson2014].

::: {#def-micsim}
Microsimulation: an analysis in which individual instantiations of a system - such as a patient's lifetime or the course of an epidemic - are generated using a random process to 'draw' from probability distributions a large number of times, in order to examine the central tendency and possibly the distribution of outcomes [@kim2008].

::: {#def-iid}
iid (**independent** and **identically distributed** random variables): each random variable has the **same probability distribution** as the others and **all** are **mutually independent**.

::: {#def-closedform-sol}
**Closed-form solution** (or closed form expression) is any formula that can be evaluated in a finite number of standard operations ([source](https://riskencyclopedia.com/articles/closed_form_solution/)).

Matrix and linear transformation:

-   Linear transformation is a function (transformation = function) that take in a vector and spit out a vector.
-   Lines remain lines, and origin remains fixed.
