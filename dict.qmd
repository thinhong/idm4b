Ad hoc: (literally Latin for "for this") means built for a particular purpose, usually quickly and temporarily, generally signifies a solution designed for a specific problem or task, non-generalizable, and not intended to be able to be adapted to other purposes, [source](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/203254/the-usage-of-ad-hoc-vs-a-priori-in-mathematical-papers).

::: {#def-cfr}
Case fatality rate (CFR): the number of deaths divided by the number of **confirmed cases** [@meyerowitz-katz2020].
:::

::: {#def-ifr}
Infection fatality rate (IFR): the number of deaths divided by the number of **infected individuals** [@meyerowitz-katz2020].
:::

::: {#def-forecast}
Forecast: predictions about what **will** happen, helpful for situation awareness.
:::

::: {#def-projection}
Projection: estimates about what **could** happen, considering multiple possible outcomes, helpful for intervention planning when faced with uncertainty.
:::

::: {#def-epidemic}
Epidemic is "the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time" (US-CDC) [@texier2016]. Epidemic is derived from the Greek *epi* and *demos* meaning "that which is upon the people", to describe the burden of some phenomenon on "the people" [@nelson2014].

::: {#def-tractable}
Tractable: can be solved [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractable)
:::

::: {#def-micsim}
Microsimulation: an analysis in which individual instantiations of a system - such as a patient's lifetime or the course of an epidemic - are generated using a random process to 'draw' from probability distributions a large number of times, in order to examine the central tendency and possibly the distribution of outcomes [@kim2008].
:::

::: {#def-iid}
iid (**independent** and **identically distributed** random variables): each random variable has the **same probability distribution** as the others and **all** are **mutually independent**.
:::

::: {#def-closedform-sol}
**Closed-form solution** (or closed form expression) is any formula that can be evaluated in a finite number of standard operations ([source](https://riskencyclopedia.com/articles/closed_form_solution/)).
:::

infection fatality ratio (IFR) and case fatality ratio (CFR) and serology data.

::: {#def-residual}
**Residual**: is the difference between the observed value and the **estimated** value.
:::

::: {#def-error}
**Error**: is the deviation of the observed value from the **true** value.
:::

Matrix and linear transformation:

-   Linear transformation is a function (transformation = function) that take in a vector and spit out a vector.
-   Lines remain lines, and origin remains fixed.

::: {#def-inv-matrix}
Inverse matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}$$

::: {#def-monte-carlo}
Monte Carlo methods or Monte Carlo experiments: using repeated random sampling simulation to obtain numerical results.

Transpose: flips a matrix/vector such that row become column and column become row. Notation: $A^\intercal$

$$\begin{align}
A &= \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \end{bmatrix} \\
A^\intercal &= \begin{bmatrix} a & d \\ b & e \\ c & f \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}$$

$$\begin{align}
A &= \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \end{bmatrix} \\
A^\intercal &= \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}

Tensor: an object with > 1 dimension

Matrix: an object with 2 dimensions

A **probability** is between 0 and 1 and is the chance (or risk) that an event (death, infection, etc...) happens. In general this probability is defined ***over a period of time*** and will necessarily increase as the duration of this period of time increases.

::: {#def-rate}
A **rate** is the number of new events that occur during specified time period [@selvin2004]. It is thus always positive (because both the number of events and time period are positive) and always expressed per unit of time (like speed km/h or m/s). Rate can be \> 1. Mathematically, it is the limit of the above-mentioned probability when the duration of the period of time tends towards zero (i.e. very small, i.e. instantaneous measure).

A **proportion** is the ratio of a numerator and a denominator and by definition is between 0 and 1.

What is the difference between **proportion** and **probability**? Consider this example:

A bag is filled with 100 balls, of which 30 are [blue]{style="color: blue"} and 70 are [green]{style="color: green"}. Without looking, you pull out a ball, write down the color, then put it back to the bag. You repeat the action 10,000 times. The number of times you pulled out a [blue]{style="color: blue"} ball is 3011.

- The proportion of [blue]{style="color: blue"} balls in the bag is 30/100 = 0.3
- A **Frequentist** say: The probability of pulling out a [blue]{style="color: blue"} ball is 3011/10,000 = 0.3011 because you did experiment in long-run (10,000 times).
- A **Bayesian** say: The probability of pulling out a [blue]{style="color: blue"} ball is 0.3 because you know that you have a proportion of 0.3 [blue]{style="color: blue"} balls in the bag.

::: {#def-hazard}
Hazard: is the probability an event occurs at time $t$, conditionally on being at risk.

$$h(t) = \mathbb{P}(T = t|Survive = 1)$$

In infectious disease modelling, hazard is the force of infection [@hay2024].

:::

::: {#def-cum-inc}
Cumulative incidence or cumulative distribution function: is the probability an event occurs at anytime before time $t$.

$$I(t) = \mathbb{P}(T \leq t)$$
